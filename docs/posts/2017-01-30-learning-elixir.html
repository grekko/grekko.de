<h1>Learning Elixir</h1>
<p>Published at: 2017-01-30</p>

<p>I have some unbooked time I am currently investing to learn <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-why">The Why</h2>
<p>Elixir brings several interesting technical concepts (of which many already blogged about and)
which are not really <strong>new</strong>. While I am really interested in the technical opportunities those
features unlock I am much more interested in the â€“ I&#39;d call them <em>soft qualities</em> of the language
and moreover its ecosystem.</p>
<p>There are 3 of those <em>soft qualities</em> I care about:</p>
<h3 id="the-community">The community</h3>
<p>There are so many <strong>really nice</strong> people in the community. Everytime I watch a video, read a
blogpost or talk to someone who works with/for Elixir I get the feeling that these people
really care about their users.</p>
<h3 id="the-tooling">The tooling</h3>
<p>More on that later.</p>
<h3 id="docs-being-first-class">Docs being first-class</h3>
<p>Elixir provides something called <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/docs-tests-and-with.html#doctests">Doctests</a>
which are a built-in feature of the language. No extensions, no configuration,.. it. just. works.</p>
<p>A Doctest is an executable code example (similar to a unit-test specification) that is
embedded with the implementation, executed with sample input. It basically tries to
solve the problem of deviating technical docs and their implementation.</p>
<p>Of course Elixir is not the first language to offer something like this but the degree
of convenience is simply astounding.</p>
<h2 id="the-how">The How</h2>
<p>To get familiar with the language I give myself 14 days (each day about 3-4 hours)
learning. I will focus on three things:</p>
<h3 id="learn-the-basics">Learn the basics</h3>
<p>There are lots of good books/blog posts to get familiar with the core data types
and fundamental concepts of functional programming and pattern matching. I will
add the ones I worked with later.</p>
<h3 id="get-practical">Get practical</h3>
<p>I will apply learned theory by working on the Advent of Code 2016. This will take the
first 4-7 Days. This will teach me the practiical basics.</p>
<h3 id="built-an-app">Built an app</h3>
<p>And finally I want to build something I can use. I dont know yet what it will be
but it might be just another phoenix web application.</p>
<p>I will document my experience and learnings while I go along.</p>
