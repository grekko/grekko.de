<h1>Testing the Kinesis Advantage Pro</h1>
<p>Published at: 2017-01-23</p>

<p>I recently started to observe some minor discomfort while coding with the
Microsoft Wired Keyboard 600 which I started typing with 10 months ago.</p>
<p>This was when I decided to give more ergonomic keyboards a try.</p>
<p>Just recently I noticed the wide variety of options when martin fowler <a href="https://twitter.com/martinfowler/status/815974878675353600">posted</a>
something about him trying out the Kinesis Advantage Pro (KAP). After reading
Avdi Grimms Post <a href="http://www.virtuouscode.com/2016/10/06/why-you-should-spend-350-on-a-computer-keyboard/">Why you should spend $350 on a computer keyboard</a>
I decided to give the Kinesis a try.</p>
<h2 id="adapting-to-the-kinesis">Adapting to the Kinesis</h2>
<p>While I see the problem (e.g. <em>Vendor lock-in</em>) of learning and therefore investing and
relying on a manufacturer-specific piece of hardware, especially for something as profound
as typing, I also think that re-learning basic skills help to deepen understanding of
fundamental concepts, e.g. typing.</p>
<p>Well, lets see about that!</p>
<p>To make my learning process somewhat more quantifiable I decided to use <a href="https://10fastfingers.com/">10FastFingers.com</a>
to measure my current typing speed with the Microsoft Keyboard and compare it daily
with my achieved typing speed with the KAP.</p>
<p>I dont consider pure typing speed as a sole success factor but its the easiest
measurable metric and its sole purpose is to allow a somewhat comparable metric.</p>
<p>The baseline speed with the Microsoft Keyboard is around 80 WPM.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/kap-original.png" alt="Words per Minute with the Microsoft Keyboard"></p>
<h3 id="day-1">Day 1</h3>
<p>The first day was pretty brutal and displayed shortcomings regarding my current typing
technique.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/kap-day1.png" alt="Words per Minute on day 1"></p>
<h3 id="day-2">Day 2</h3>
<p>Day 2 I introduced the foot pedal. More on that later. I mapped it to <code>shift</code> but after
using it for 3-4 hours my leg started aching. The progress in terms of WPM was not
huge.</p>
<p>Three reasons. First: I did not train a lot, just 3-4 hours overall. Second: I started
properly coding, resulting in slowly re-learning all those precious muscle-memory
dependant shortcuts and commands. Third: I realized that a lot of my typing is not
<code>writing words</code> but commanding the computer to switch contexts, navigate the filesystem,
search for text in files or eventually on the screen.</p>
<p>I excited to see whats happening in the next 5-10 days.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/kap-day2.png" alt="Words per Minute on day 2"></p>
<h3 id="day-3">Day 3</h3>
<p>I ditched the foot pedal. Also I started to invest some time to think about
different ways of key-remapping.</p>
<p>Over the day I spent about 3-4 hours typing, partially coding, partially
writing text. Overall I mildly improved my WPM from 14 to 22.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/kap-day3.png" alt="Words per Minute on day 3"></p>
<p>I definately dont want to change existing key-mappings since I will keep on
using the not-ergonomic Microsoft keyboard and dont want to relearn two things
at once.</p>
<p>Therefore will investigate a software-solution to keep the same key-mappings
but having an additional layer of <code>meta-mapping</code> when working with the kinesis.</p>
<h3 id="day-4-5">Day 4 &amp; 5</h3>
<p>I am starting to gain some typing speed back (current WPM ~ 37) and I observed
several problematic keys and key-combinations which I am still struggling with a lot.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/kap-day4-5.png" alt="Words per Minute on day 4 &amp; 5"></p>
<p>The most problematic keys are the parentheses (<code>[</code>, <code>{</code>, <code>&lt;</code> â€¦) other special chars
e.g. the pipe <code>|</code>, the backtick <code>\`</code> and tilde <code>~</code> which I actually use pretty
frequently. Many of those mentioned keys are only reachable with the pinky or
ring finger. I don&#39;t know if this is just a matter of proper training. Let&#39;s see.</p>
<p>Otherwise most of my keyboard mappings seem to somehow be persisted into my brain.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t say that I feel completely comfortable with the KAP but it feels like
getting closer to a somewhat &quot;better place&quot;.</p>
