<h1>How I work</h1>

<p>These are some principles I try to work by. Exceptions included.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Automate almost everything that is part of your working process. Time savings doesn't have to be the driving factor.</li>
  <li>Trust is the driving force in a functional team. Nurture it.</li>
  <li>Don't set a meeting without a clear goal. Don't join such meetings.</li>
</ol>
