      The art of destroying software
    </a>
    <p>by <a href="https://goodenoughsoftware.net/">Greg Young</a>, 2014, 42min.</p>

    <p>
    Greg talks about a different perspective on managing complexity in software projects by focusing on
    keeping units of code so small that they are disposable and easily rewritable in approximately one week of work for one person.
    </p>
    <p>
    Having this mindset forbids a developer to accumulate big chunks of code that are <em>too big to refactor</em> or more concrete
    <em>to big too just throw away and rewrite</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Gaining the freedom to just rewrite certain parts of a codebase once the domain problem has been better understood would
    reduce the business risk dramatically for a <em>partial rewrite</em>.
    <em>to big too just throw away and rewrite</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
    While I am flirting with the fundamental idea I still wonder how to avoid the <em>god objects</em> in a codebase and instead
    properly slice an application in such small parts that I could arrive at such an <em>disposable architecture</em>.
