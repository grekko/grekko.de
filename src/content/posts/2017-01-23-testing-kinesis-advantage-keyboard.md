title: "Testing the Kinesis Advantage Pro"
---

I recently started to observe some minor discomfort while coding with the
Microsoft Wired Keyboard 600 which I started typing with 10 months ago.

This was when I decided to give more ergonomic keyboards a try.

Just recently I noticed the wide variety of options when martin fowler [posted](https://twitter.com/martinfowler/status/815974878675353600)
something about him trying out the Kinesis Advantage Pro (KAP). After reading
Avdi Grimms Post [Why you should spend $350 on a computer keyboard](http://www.virtuouscode.com/2016/10/06/why-you-should-spend-350-on-a-computer-keyboard/)
I decided to give the Kinesis a try.


## Adapting to the Kinesis

While I see the problem (e.g. *Vendor lock-in*) of learning and therefore investing and
relying on a manufacturer-specific piece of hardware, especially for something as profound
as typing, I also think that re-learning basic skills help to deepen understanding of
fundamental concepts, e.g. typing.

Well, lets see about that!

To make my learning process somewhat more quantifiable I decided to use [10FastFingers.com](https://10fastfingers.com/)
to measure my current typing speed with the Microsoft Keyboard and compare it daily
with my achieved typing speed with the KAP.

I dont consider pure typing speed as a sole success factor but its the easiest
measurable metric and its sole purpose is to allow a somewhat comparable metric.

The baseline speed with the Microsoft Keyboard is around 80 WPM.

### Day 1

The first day was pretty brutal and displayed shortcomings regarding my current typing
technique.
